# ECE 651 â€“ Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains assignments for **ECE 651: Digital Signal Processing**.

## Course Overview
ECE 651 provides a comprehensive introduction to digital signal processing (DSP), covering both theoretical foundations and practical techniques. Key topics include:

- Time-domain analysis of discrete-time signals and systems  
- The **z-transform** and system characterization  
- Frequency analysis of signals and systems  
- **Sampling** and reconstruction of continuous signals  
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**  
- Discrete-time system implementation  
- **Filter design** techniques  
- **Multirate DSP** concepts  
- **Wavelet transform** methods
